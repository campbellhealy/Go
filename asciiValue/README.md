# Change a list (Slice) from characters to ASCII values
# Convert it back to characters


I found the converting back did not include the ' or , characters.
Therefore I introduced an intial stage that is similar to the last stage removing
these characters. In a real world excerise the data would have to be imported in 
the format that this convertion did. I had tried to use that data but it did work in the 
process I was using.

I was intending to compare the last stage to the initial input to ensure the converstion 
did not lose any data. 
Data was used in a similar script written in Python and it did handle as expected and I 
could assert against the original data.
